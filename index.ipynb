    "# Generating Word Embeddings - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll learn how to generate word embeddings by training a Word2Vec model, and then embedding layers into Deep Neural Networks for NLP!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonstrate a basic understanding of the architecture of the Word2Vec model\n",
    "* Demonstrate an understanding of the various tunable parameters of word2vec such as vector size and window size\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll start by creating your own word embeddings by making use of the Word2Vec Model. Then, you'll move onto building Neural Networks that make use of **_Embedding Layers_** to accomplish the same end-goal, but directly in your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen, the easiest way to make use of Word2Vec is to import it from the [Gensim Library](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). This model contains a full implementation of Word2Vec, which you can use to begin training immediately. For this lab, you'll be working with the [News Category Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset/version/2#_=_).  This dataset contains headlines and article descriptions from the news, as well as categories for which type of article they belong to.\n",

By doing this for every piece of text in the entire dataset, the Word2Vec model learns excellent vector representations for each word in an **_Embedding Space_**, where the relationships between vectors capture semantic meaning (recall the vector that captures gender in the previous \"king - man + woman = queen\" example you saw).\n",

    "As a final exercise, try to recreate the _'king' - 'man' + 'woman' = 'queen'_ example previously mentioned. You can do this by using the `most_similar` function and translating the word analogies into an addition/subtraction formulation (as shown above). Pass the original comparison, which you are calculating a difference between, to the negative parameter, and the analogous starter you want to apply the same transformation to, to the `positive` parameter.\n",

    "As you can see from the output above, your model isn't perfect, but 'Queen' is still in the top 3, and with 'Princess' not too far behind. As you can see from the word in first place, 'reminiscent', your model is far from perfect. This is likely because you didn't have enough training data. That said, given the small amount of training data provided, the model still performs remarkably well! \n",

Specifically, you'll work with the GloVe model from the Stanford NLP Group. There's not really any benefit from training the model ourselves, unless your text uses different, specialized vocabulary that isn't likely to be well represented inside an open-source model.\n",
